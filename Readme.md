# SciWIn-Client Demo
This repo contains the scripts to perform a small SciWIn-Client Demo. This instructions file will be updated to use new features when they are available. The commands stated below will perform the operations based on our [hello world repo](https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_hello_world).

## Preparation and Cleanup
To prepare the environment and to download all neccessary files you just need to execute the `Makefile`
```bash
make
```
This will download all needed files from the [hello world repo](https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_hello_world) and creates a shell script to activate environments.
Run 'source set_env.sh' to apply the environment changes to the current shell.
```bash
source set_env.sh
```

To reset the directory execute the clean command which will restore the initial state.
```bash
make clean
```

## Demo Commands
To check if SciWIn is available type `s4n --version` which should output something like `s4n 0.1.0`.
### Initializing a Project
To begin the journey use `s4n init -p .` to initialize a project in the current directory.
### Creation of CommandLineTools
To create the two CommandLineTools needed for the demo you just have to prefix the execution commands with `s4n tool create` or `s4n run`.
#### Calculation
To create the `calculation.cwl` tool run the following command:
```bash
s4n run python calculation.py --population population.csv --speakers speakers_revised.csv
```
which will output
```

📜 Found changes:

📄 Created CWL file workflows/calculation/calculation.cwl
```
#### Plot
The Plot tool will use the created results.csv. The creation command is 
```bash
s4n run python plot.py --results results.csv
```
which will lead to the following output:
```
📂 The current working directory is /home/ubuntu/sciwin_test
▶️  Executing command: python plot.py --results results.csv

📜 Found changes:
        - results.svg

📄 Created CWL file workflows/plot/plot.cwl
```
### Workflow Creation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will currently need to be in the `feature/workflows` branch for that!
#### Workflow Creation
To create a Workflow with name `demo` simply call 
```bash
s4n workflow create demo
```
which will output
```
📄 Created new Workflow file: workflows/demo/demo.cwl
```

#### Connecting Tools
To connect the steps in the workflow you need to call `s4n workflow connect` a couple of times.

##### Connecting Inputs
First we will connect the `calculation` tool to the input sockets. The tool has two inputs which we will connect to the `speaker`s and `pop` input.
```bash
s4n workflow connect demo --from @inputs/speakers --to calculation/speakers
s4n workflow connect demo --from @inputs/pop --to calculation/population
```
An example output looks like
```
➕ Added step calculation to workflow
➕ Added or updated connection from inputs.speakers to calculation/speakers in workflow
✔️  Updated Workflow workflows/demo/demo.cwl!
```

##### Connecting Tools
We now will connect the `plot` and the `calculation` tool. We will map results-output to results-input.
```bash
s4n workflow connect demo --from calculation/results --to plot/results
```
An example output looks like
```
🔗 Found step calculation in workflow. Not changing that!
➕ Added step plot to workflow
✔️  Updated Workflow workflows/demo/demo.cwl!
```

##### Connecting to output
To get the results file we will connect the result of the plot step to out.
```bash
s4n workflow connect demo --from plot/results --to @outputs/out
```
which outputs
```
➕ Added or updated connection from plot/results to outputs.out in workflow!
✔️  Updated Workflow workflows/demo/demo.cwl!
```

We now have a full workflow which can be executed by cwltool
```bash
cwltool workflows/demo/demo.cwl --pop population.csv --speakers speakers_revised.csv
```
or `s4n execute workflows/demo/demo.cwl --pop population.csv --speakers speakers_revised.csv` in a later stage (execution branch currently only supports commandlinetools)


### Execution with SciWIn
The command is `s4n execute local` which can be shortened by `s4n ex l`
#### Execution of CommandLineTools
You can execute CWL CommandLineTools in a custom runner on all major systems (Windows, Mac, Linux). The custom runner does not support containerization yet, so you need to make sure all required tools are available. The runner is work in progress!
##### Execution with no arguments
SciWIn client adds defaults to your tools so you can just rerun the cwl without any parameters:
```
s4n ex l workflows/plot/plot.cwl 
```
Outputs:
```
💻 Executing workflows/plot/plot.cwl using SciWIn's custom runner. Use `--runner cwltool` to use reference runner (if installed). SciWIn's runner currently only supports 'CommandLineTools'!

  }
}
✔️  Command Executed with status: success!
```

##### Execution with arguments
You may need to change the arguments provided in CWL. You can either do this by giving the arguments appended to the command or use an input yaml file:
```yml
population:
  class: File
  location: population.csv
speakers:
  class: File
  location: speakers_revised.csv
```
```bash
s4n ex l workflows/calculation/calculation.cwl inputs.yml 
```
or give the separated arguments
```bash
s4n ex l workflows/calculation/calculation.cwl --speakers speakers_revised.csv --population population.csv 
```
